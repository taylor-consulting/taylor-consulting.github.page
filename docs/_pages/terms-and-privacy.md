## 2. Privacy Notice

I care about privacy and aim to keep tracking minimal and transparent.

### 2.1 What I Do **Not** Do

When you visit **taylor-consulting.com**, **I do not**:

- Ask you to create an account or log in.
- Intentionally collect personally identifiable information (such as your name, address, or phone number).
- Sell, rent, or trade your data.

If you contact me directly (for example, by email or social media or through the contact form), I will receive whatever information you choose to share and will use it only to respond to you.

### 2.2 Analytics (Fathom Analytics)

This site uses **[Fathom Analytics](https://usefathom.com)** to understand overall traffic and site usage.

- Fathom is a **privacy-focused**, **cookie-free** analytics tool.
- It does **not** use cookies and is designed not to store personally identifiable information.
- The data I see is aggregated and anonymous, such as:
  - Page views and popular pages
  - Referring sites (e.g., “came from another website”)
  - General technical information (e.g., device type, browser)

I use this information to:

- Understand which content is useful
- Improve navigation and performance
- Decide what to write or create next

For details on how Fathom handles data, see their own documentation and privacy policy on [usefathom.com](https://usefathom.com).

### 2.3 Hosting (GitHub Pages)

These sites are hosted on **[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)**.

- When you visit, GitHub may log standard technical information (such as IP address, user agent, date/time, and requested page) for security and operational reasons.
- This logging is handled by GitHub, not directly by me.
- For more information about GitHub’s practices, please see the **GitHub Privacy Statement** on [github.com](https://github.com).

### 2.4 Cookies

- I do **not** set any cookies for tracking or advertising.
- Fathom Analytics is configured to run **without cookies**.
- GitHub Pages or embedded third-party services (for example, an embedded video or social media widget, if I add one) may set their own cookies. Those are governed by the third party’s policies.

### 2.5 Data Security

These are static sites with no login system and minimal data collection, which reduces risk. However:

- No system or transmission over the internet is ever 100% secure.
- I cannot guarantee absolute security but take reasonable care in how I configure and maintain the sites.

### 2.6 Children’s Privacy

These sites are not specifically directed at children.
